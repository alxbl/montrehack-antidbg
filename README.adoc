= Montrehack: Anti-debugging Workshop
Alexandre Beaulieu <alex@segfault.me>

This repository contains the challenge source code as well as the solution
outline.  The binaries and PDBs from the workshop are included as well as the
x64dbg database file for those who would like to follow along. If you place the
PDB on your symbol path, x64dbg will pick it up and display all symbol
information as well as source line numbers. Additionally, you can do the challenge
in WinDbg and even follow along with the source code.

Please note that the code itself is super buggy and most likely vulnerable to
many things including out of bounds I/O and memory leaks. The code was made to
get the challenges up and running quickly and demonstrate the techniques in a
simple context.

== Using the x64dbg database

Go to your x64dbg unpack directory and find `release/x64/db` and place
`debugme.exe.dd64` there. You may want to back up your original database to
keep your work during the workshop.

Any subsequent launch of the binary should have all the annotations from my
solution. Enjoy!
